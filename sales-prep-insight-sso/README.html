<h2 id="demonstrates">Demonstrates</h2>
<p>This sample demonstrates the following aspects of Oracle Cloud integration</p>
<h3 id="primary-goals">Primary Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Showcase JCS - SaaS Extension as an option to build UI extensions to Oracle Sales Cloud. An ADF application is deployed in JCS - SaaS Extension with the same look and feel as Oracle Sales Cloud. This extended UI will be embedded within the Oracle Sales Cloud UI.</li>
<li>To leverage pre-wired SSO between Oracle Sales Cloud and JCS - SaaS Extension such that the embedded application (which by itself is protected) does not challenge an already logged-in Oracle Sales Cloud user.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secondary-goals">Secondary Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>To showcase Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema) as the data store for the application deployed on JCS - SaaS Extension.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="functional-overview">Functional Overview</h2>
<p>Prior to meeting their existing accounts for additional sales opportunities, the sales representatives of XYZ Inc. would like to know if these accounts have any critical or long pending Service Requests (SRs) that are open and relevant to their sales process. With this insight the representatives are able to reach out to internal teams to understand more about these SRs. The sales reps would like to see the list of these SRs along with their statuses automatically show up for each account on Oracle Sales Cloud, rather than having to reach out to the Service team of their organization to obtain the same information. Additionally, the reps would also like to be current on the latest news about their accounts such as leadership changes, recent announcements, or anything else that may impact their selling ability. This insight could come from their internal research team or public websites.</p>
<h2 id="technical-overview">Technical Overview</h2>
<p>The Sales Preparation Insight application is deployed to JCS - SaaS Extension and displays the open SRs related to a given customer. The application also provides news articles from internal sources and public news that match the account name or the industry name. For the sake of simplicity this application mocks up all this data. The mock data is stored in Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema). Based on the account ID, which is passed as a URL parameter to this application, different mock data is shown.</p>
<p>This application is then embedded as an iFrame within the Account widget of the Oracle Sales Cloud UI. Whenever a sales rep opens an account, he or she can click a sub-tab for that account that displays this embedded application.</p>
<p>The key objective of this sample is to show that the embedded application, although running as a protected application on JCS - SaaS Extension, does not show a log in page when a sales rep navigates to the sub-tab. This is because of the pre-wired SSO configuration between Oracle Sales Cloud and JCS - SaaS Extension. Since the sales rep is already signed into Oracle Sales Cloud, the embedded page is directly displayed. (See the Known Issues section at the end of this README if you encounter problems.)</p>

<h2 id="user-and-role-setup">User and Role Setup:</h2>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-sample">Setting up the Sample</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The JCS - SaaS Extension and Oracle Sales Cloud instances should be associated. Refer to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=clouddevportal&amp;id=GUID-9C1BA413-EB5D-429C-AECA-4069995385EF">Getting a JCS - SaaS Extension Subscription</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=clouddevportal&amp;id=GUID-19C1D17A-195D-4CB3-AD04-0224F629165B">Security Strategies for JCS - SaaS Extension and Oracle Sales Cloud interactions</a> for more details.</li>
<li>For JCS - SaaS Extension, a user with the <em>Java Administrator</em> Role to deploy an application to the JCS - SaaS Extension instance is required. Refer to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=clouddevportal&amp;id=GUID-9C1BA413-EB5D-429C-AECA-4069995385EF">Getting a JCS - SaaS Extension Subscription</a> for more details about the <em>Java Administrator</em> Role. Refer to Chapter 7, &quot;Managing Users and Roles&quot; in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&amp;id=CSGSG166">Getting Started with Oracle Cloud</a> for more details on creating users.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="running-the-sample">Running the Sample</h3>
<p>Create a new user or use an existing user that exists in both Oracle Sales Cloud and JCS - SaaS Extension. The role of this user in Oracle Sales Cloud could be <em>Sales Administrator</em>. There is no role logic for the user in JCS - SaaS Extension in this sample.</p>
<h2 id="install-instructions">Install Instructions</h2>
<p>Clone the Git repository to your local working directory. The steps below will assume that you are using git. However you can also download the code from OTN to your local working directory and follow the same steps below.</p>
<h3 id="oracle-database-cloud-service-database-schema">Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema)</h3>
<p>Run the SQL scripts included in the source code using the SQL command in Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema). For more details about the steps to access the SQL command, refer to the SQL Script section of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=clouddevportal&amp;id=GUID-0B2A2A62-BFB1-48C3-9398-23B7896E0E89">Creating Data Models in Oracle Database Cloud Service - Database Schema</a>.</p>
<p><em>git-home</em>/sales-prep-insight-sso/DbCS/SalesPrepCreateInsert.sql</p>
<h3 id="jcs---saas-extension">JCS - SaaS Extension</h3>
<p>Use JDeveloper to build the ADF application EAR and deploy it to JCS-SaaS Extension:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the .jws in JDeveloper or Eclipse. Refer to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=clouddevportal&amp;id=GUID-645953AE-3C6F-40DD-AF06-03D466DEFECE">Configuring IDEs for Developing with JCS - SaaS Extension</a> for more details about configuring JDeveloper or Eclipse. Further steps in this readme will refer to JDeveloper although similar steps can be performed in Eclipse.</li>
<li>In the IDE, open the file AccountDetailsAM.xml under Model &gt; Application Sources &gt; oracle.cloud.sampleapps &gt; accountdetails &gt; model &gt; AccountDetailsAM, click on configurations, double click AccountDetailsAMLocal, and under the Connection type, the existing value will be YourDbCSDataSourceName. Change this to the JNDI name of the Datasource as provided in the JCS - SaaS Extension console. During development/debug time, you will likely be working with a local instance (instead of JCS - SaaS Extension). In that case, you can change the connection type to <em>JDBC URL</em> and provide the JDBC URL of the local database.</li>
<li><p>ADF applications are automatically configured for framebusting to prevent other applications from embedding them. This measure is normally used to ensure the correct formatting and to prevent click-jacking. Because, in this special Oracle Cloud to Oracle Cloud extension use case, we require embedding, the ADF Application should be manually configured to disable Framebusting (refer to Known Issues for more details). In the IDE, open the file web.xml under ViewController &gt; Web Content &gt; WEB-INF. Click on the Source Tab. At the end of the last context-param XML tag and before the beginning of the filter XML tag, paste the following code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;context-param&gt;
  &lt;!-- Setting FRAME_BUSTING to NEVER avoids this error - Refused to display &#39;http://...&#39; in a frame because it set &#39;X-Frame-Options&#39; to &#39;sameorigin&#39;--&gt;
  &lt;description&gt; Security precaution to prevent clickjacking- bust frames if the ancestor window domain (protocol, host, and port) and the frame domain are different. Another options for this parameter are always and never &lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.security.FRAME_BUSTING&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;never&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Deploy the application to your JCS - SaaS Extension instance. Refer to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=clouddevportal&amp;id=GUID-8C5519F9-FB34-4D13-B313-BF0C7230A339">Deploying Applications Individually Using JCS - SaaS Extension Control</a> for more details.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="oracle-sales-cloud">Oracle Sales Cloud</h3>
<p>Make customizations to Oracle Sales Cloud to embed the ADF UI.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: It is critical to perform all Oracle Sales Cloud development/customization work in an activated sandbox. Not only does this aid in testing and debugging, but it also greatly simplifies un-installing/rolling back sample application extensions when required. Given that all customizations will be isolated to a sandbox, it is necessary to communicate sandbox details to others so that they can interact with sample application customizations while acting in different roles.</p>
<p>The steps involved in rolling back Oracle Sales Cloud customizations published from sandboxes to the main code line will not be documented here.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create or activate a sandbox as required. Refer to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=clouddevportal&amp;id=GUID-73F02E54-38FB-4081-BD9D-4570DD26CDBD">Understanding the Basics of Oracle Sales Cloud Customization and Integration Features</a> for details.</li>
<li>Register AccountDetails as a third party app.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Application Name:</em> AccountDetails</li>
<li><em>Partner Name:</em> AccountDetails</li>
<li><em>Full URL:</em> https://your_sales_cloud_URL/AccountDetails. For instructions on registering a Third Party App, refer to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=clouddevportal&amp;id=GUID-73F02E54-38FB-4081-BD9D-4570DD26CDBD">Understanding the Basics of Oracle Sales Cloud Customization and Integration Features</a> for more details.</li>
